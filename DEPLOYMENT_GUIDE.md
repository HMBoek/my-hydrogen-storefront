```

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your deployment platform:

```bash
SESSION_SECRET="foobar"
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN=weaverse-hydrogen.myshopify.com
PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=939ac830f7c7c6d229a24dd78f4258f0
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID=shp_182e9ed0-270f-473a-be74-e3073f852c39

```

## GitHub CI/CD Setup (Recommended)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Oxygen
        run: npx shopify hydrogen deploy --environment production
        env:
          SHOPIFY_CLI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SHOPIFY_CLI_TOKEN }}
```

## Custom Domain Setup

1. **For Oxygen**: Configure in Shopify Partner dashboard
2. **For other platforms**: 
   - Add CNAME record pointing to platform's domain
   - Configure SSL certificate
   - Update environment variables if needed

## Monitoring & Analytics

Add to your deployment:
- Google Analytics (set PUBLIC_GOOGLE_GTM_ID)
- Sentry for error tracking
- Performance monitoring tools

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your deployment platform** based on your needs
2. **Set up environment variables** on chosen platform
3. **Configure custom domain** if needed
4. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments
5. **Monitor performance** and optimize as needed
